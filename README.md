## Logic 

### Deposits Requirements

- Transaction ID must be unique
- Transaction Amount > 0.0001
- Client Account must not be frozen

### Withdrawal Requirements

* *Transaction ID must be unique*
* *Transaction Amount > 0.0001*
* *Available funds in User Account must be greater than Transaction Amount* 
* *Client Account must not be frozen*

### Dispute Requirements

- Transaction ID must be in the Transactions History that our Engine has made
- The client from the Transactions History must be the same as the client who is creating a Dispute
- Transaction Amount > 0.0001 
- Client Account must not be frozen

#### *Dispute Deposit*

- Available funds in User Account must be greater than Transaction Amount of dispute
    
When you are actually creating a dispute of a Deposit transaction, your transactions amount dispute will decrease your available funds with that amount. Also, increasing the amount to held.

#### *Dispute Withdrawal*

When you are actually creating a dispute of a Withdrawal transaction, you will be adding the transaction amount to the held funds, also increasing total amount. These funds will not be on available until resolving the dispute.
